    "My project is a Choose Your Own Adventure game. There are several choices, paths, and a total of sixteen different endings, two of which result in the player \"winning\" the game. I have included a text cell above extra credit that shows the paths to each ending (included for grading purposes only). This game takes in user information and crafts the beginning of the game accordingly, then everything that happens is 100% based on the choices the user makes. \n",

    "In this game, you're being led into prison, and you quickly meet your good-intentioned but maybe overzealous cellmate who wants to try and break out, and you decide (or don't) to go with them. From there, the story is yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game/storyline was inspired by Bandersnatch, a choose your own adventure movie from the Black Mirror universe; A Heist with Markiplier, a choose your own adventure YouTube series that involves a museum heist and a prison break; and A Way Out, a choose your own adventure video game that follows two escaped convicts.\n",

    "The game was originally put into functions more so to organize it than to utilize the actual structure and functionality of functions, but it ended up making the whole game run more smoothly. If you are playing this over and over, it should prompt you immediately after running the first block, but after about 4-5 runs, it will slow down. I have found that restarting the kernel fixes this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pytest note: I couldn't get pytest to run in this file, but I got it to run elsewhere successfully. Geoff said in office hours this was alright as long as I acknowledged it. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had a ton of fun making this game, and I hope you enjoy playing it!\n"
